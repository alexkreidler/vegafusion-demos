This has the advantage of making the charts produced by Altair fully standalone, not requiring access to a running Python kernel to render properly. But it has the disadvantage of making it difficult to access the transformed data (e.g. the histogram bin edges and count values) from Python. Since VegaFusion evaluates these transforms in the Python kernel, it’s possible to access then from Python using the `vegafusion.transformed_data()` function.\n",

    "While the VegaFusion mime renderer works great for non-interactive Altair charts, it’s not as well suited for interactive charts visualizing large datasets. This is because the mime renderer does not maintain a live connection between the browser and the python kernel, so all the data that participates in an interaction must be sent to the browser.\n",

    "To address this situation, VegaFusion provides a Jupyter Widget based renderer that does maintain a live connection between the chart in the browser and the Python kernel. In this configuration, selection operations (e.g. filtering to the extents of a brush selection) can be evaluated interactively in the Python kernel, which eliminates the need to transfer the full dataset to the client in order to maintain interactivity.\n",
